// deliberately not a parameter: the question this answers is whether the
// entry, exactly as it stands, authorizes what it claims to. A caller that
// wants to know whether a *different* expiration would be accepted is asking
// about an entry that does not exist yet, and should build it first.
//
// Only classic account signatures — the built-in vector holding one
// {public_key, signature} map — can be decided offline. A custom account's
// __check_auth may accept any ScVal at all, and only the contract can say
// whether a given value is valid, so such a node is reported as
// VerdictCannotCheck and never as verified. The signature is checked against
// the public key it carries; whether that key is actually a signer of the
// account, and whether enough signers signed to meet the account's threshold,
// are questions about account state this engine cannot see offline and does
// not claim to answer.
//
// Every credential node in the entry is checked: the top-level node and, for
// the delegates arm, every delegate at every depth. A node with no signature
// is reported VerdictUnsigned rather than failed, because CAP-71-01 permits a
// Void top-level signature when only delegates authenticate; Verified reports
// it as not verified all the same, and a caller applies its own policy.
