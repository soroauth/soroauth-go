	// ledger, so re-signing one node with a different expiration silently
	// invalidates the signatures on all the others. It is also returned when

	// credentials arm, because the payload type changes underneath the
	// existing signature. Pass AllowResign when overwriting is intended.
	ErrAlreadySigned = errors.New("credential node is already signed")

	// ErrInvalidExpiration is returned for an expiration ledger that cannot be
	// used: zero, an overflowing sum, or one that disagrees with the
	// expiration already committed to by existing signatures on the entry.
	//
	// Zero is rejected rather than treated as "no expiry" because the host

	// (rs-soroban-env soroban-env-host/src/auth.rs, verify_and_consume_nonce:

	// the network, or a caller is untrusted, so DecodeAuthorizationEntry and

	// plan passed to WithDelegatePlans names an address that matches no
	// entry's top-level address in the batch.
	//
	// A plan entry that matches nothing is very likely a typo or a stale
	// plan left over from a removed entry, and applying it silently would
