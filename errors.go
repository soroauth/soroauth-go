// The sentinel errors soroauth returns. Every one of them is matched with
// errors.Is, and every function that can produce one wraps it with
// fmt.Errorf("soroauth: <operation>: %w", err) so the message says what was
// being attempted while the sentinel stays comparable.
//
// These describe refusals, not failures. soroauth produces signatures that
// authorize value to move, so wherever the protocol or the caller's intent is
// ambiguous the library declines and returns one of these rather than guessing
// at what was meant.

	// That arm has no payload to sign: the transaction envelope's own
	// signature covers it, so there is no HashIdPreimage variant for it and

	// AuthorizeEntry, which passes such entries through untouched so callers
	// can hand it every entry simulation returned.

	//
	// This is the fail-closed half of soroauth's target-address rule: a
	// signature is only ever written onto a node whose address equals the
	// target, so when nothing matches, the call fails instead of writing the
	// signature somewhere it does not belong. It is the error a caller sees
	// after signing with the wrong key, or naming an address via ForAddress
	// that is not in the delegate tree.
	ErrNoMatchingCredentialNode = errors.New("no credential node matches the target address")

	// ErrDuplicateDelegate is returned when one address appears twice within a

	// verify against the payload it was just given.
	//
	// Ed25519Signer verifies its own output before handing it back. The cost
	// is one verification; what it catches is a corrupted key, a faulty
	// signer, or memory damage producing a signature that would be rejected
	// on-chain only after fees were paid.

	// means a transaction that is accepted, charged for, and then fails during

	// a signature that is already present.
	//
	// Under CAP-71-01 every signature-bearing node in a delegates entry
	// commits to the same payload, and that payload includes the expiration
	// ledger, so re-signing one node with a different expiration silently
	// invalidates the signatures on all the others. It is also returned when
	// an entry that already carries a signature is converted to a different
	// credentials arm, because the payload type changes underneath the
	// existing signature. Pass AllowResign when overwriting is intended.
	ErrAlreadySigned = errors.New("credential node is already signed")

	// ErrInvalidExpiration is returned for an expiration ledger that cannot be
	// used: zero, an overflowing sum, or one that disagrees with the
	// expiration already committed to by existing signatures on the entry.
	//
	// Zero is rejected rather than treated as "no expiry" because the host
	// rejects an entry once the current ledger is past the stored value
	// (rs-soroban-env soroban-env-host/src/auth.rs, verify_and_consume_nonce:
	// `if ledger_seq > *live_until_ledger` → "signature has expired"), so a

	// which is 20 (rs-soroban-env
	// soroban-env-host/src/builtin_contracts/account_contract.rs:25, enforced
	// at :185 with "too many account signers"). Exceeding it is rejected here
	// rather than on-chain.

	// invokeHostFunction operation, and therefore no authorization entries at
	// all.

	// An empty result would be indistinguishable from an envelope whose invoke
	// operation simply has nothing to authorize, so this is an error rather
