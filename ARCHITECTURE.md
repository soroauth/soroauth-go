# Architecture

soroauth turns an unsigned `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` into a correctly signed
one. This document explains what that involves, how the pieces fit, and which
rules are protocol requirements rather than local choices.

## The problem

When a Soroban contract calls `require_auth()` on an address that is **not** the
transaction's source account, the transaction must carry a signed authorization
entry for that address. The entry has two halves:

```
SorobanAuthorizationEntry
├── credentials      who approves, plus nonce, expiration, and signature
└── rootInvocation   the call tree being approved
```

The signer never signs the entry. It signs `SHA-256(XDR(HashIdPreimage))`, and
**which preimage variant applies is decided by the credentials arm**:

| Credentials arm | Value | Preimage variant | Address in signed bytes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_SOURCE_ACCOUNT` | 0 | none — the envelope signature covers it | n/a |
| `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS` | 1 | `ENVELOPE_TYPE_SOROBAN_AUTHORIZATION` (9) | no |
| `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS_V2` | 2 | `..._WITH_ADDRESS` (10) | yes |
| `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS_WITH_DELEGATES` | 3 | `..._WITH_ADDRESS` (10), bound to the **top-level** address | yes |

Arms 1 is CAP-46-11. Arms 2 and 3 are CAP-71-01 and CAP-71-02.

## Signing flow

   unsigned entries ──► Preimage(entry, validUntil, passphrase)
                              │
                              ▼
                        HashIdPreimage

                              ▼
                        Payload() = SHA-256
                              │
                              ▼
                     Signer.Sign(ctx, preimage, payload) ──► ScVal
                              │
                              ▼
              AuthorizeEntry writes the ScVal onto every
              credential node whose address == target
                              │
                              ▼
  simulateTransaction (enforce mode) ──► assemble ──► sign envelope ──► submit
```

Two properties hold throughout and are the reason most of the code exists:

1. **The expiration signed over and the expiration stored must be identical.**
   `AuthorizeEntry` sets both from its `validUntilLedger` argument. If they ever
   diverge the entry looks complete and fails on-chain after fees.
2. **Caller input is never mutated.** Every function returning a modified entry
   deep-copies first via `internal/xdrcopy`, because the go-stellar-sdk XDR
   types are trees of pointers and slices.

## Envelopes

Callers hold transaction envelopes, not loose entries, so every entry-shaped
function has an envelope-shaped counterpart that finds the entries for them:
`EnvelopeEntries` and `InspectEnvelope` (read), `AuthorizeEnvelope` (sign),
`EnvelopePayloads` (what a signer would be approving). Each `EnvelopeEntry`
carries the operation index and entry index it came from, which is what a
caller needs to line a signed entry back up with.

An envelope with no `invokeHostFunction` operation is refused with
`ErrNoInvokeOperation`, never reported as an empty result: "nothing to
authorize" and "nothing I looked for" must not read the same. A fee-bump
envelope is read through to its inner transaction, because a fee-bump
transaction has no operations of its own and it is the inner transaction's
entries the host checks (CAP-15).

Signing entries changes what the transaction costs to run, so the envelope
assembled from the record-mode simulation carries too small a resource fee
and is rejected on-chain after fees are paid. Once the entries are signed the
caller must simulate again in **enforce** mode and submit what that pass
produced. soroauth does not run that pass — it belongs to the caller's
RPC client — and nothing here pretends otherwise; `adapters/walletsdk`
makes a wallet say so in code before it can obtain a submittable envelope.

## Package map

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `preimage.go` | `Preimage` (variant selection), `Payload` (SHA-256), and `addressCredentials`, the accessor every arm shares |
| `signer.go` | The `Signer` interface, `NewEd25519Signer`, `NewAccountMultiSigner`, `SignerFunc`, and the account signature `ScVal` shape |
| `authorize.go` | `AuthorizeEntry`, the credential-node walk, target matching, and the resign/expiration guards |
| `delegates.go` | `Delegate`, `WithDelegates`, `ValidateDelegateOrder` — the CAP-71-01 tree |
| `invocation.go` | `AuthorizeInvocation` and nonce generation |
| `upgrade.go` | `UpgradeToV2` |
| `verify.go` | `VerifyEntry` → `VerificationReport`: rebuilds the payload from an entry as it stands and decides each classic-account signature, reporting a per-node verdict (`verified`, `unsigned`, `invalid`, `cannot_check`) |
| `inspect.go` | `Inspect` → `EntryInfo`, structural reporting only |
| `batch.go` | `AuthorizeAll`, all-or-nothing |
| `envelope.go` | `EnvelopeEntries`, `InspectEnvelope`, `AuthorizeEnvelope`, `EnvelopePayloads` — the entry-shaped functions applied to a whole `TransactionEnvelope` |
| `expiration.go` | `ExpirationAfter` |
| `address.go` | `ParseAddress` / `FormatAddress` (G… and C… only) |
| `errors.go` | The eleven exported sentinels, plus the three typed address errors (`NoMatchingCredentialNodeError`, `DuplicateDelegateError`, `MissingSignerError`) that wrap them for `errors.As` |
| `internal/xdrcopy` | Deep copy by XDR round-trip |
| `cmd/soroauth` | CLI: `payload`, `sign`, `delegates`, `inspect`, `doctor`, `cross-compile`. `inspect`, `payload` and `sign` take a whole envelope as well as a single entry, and work out which they were handed |
| `remote/` | The HTTP signing protocol: `Request`/`Response`, a reference `Server`, and a client `Signer` that satisfies `soroauth.Signer`. Transmits the preimage, not just the digest; the server recomputes the digest and refuses a mismatch. The root module does not import it |
| `adapters/walletsdk` | A **separate Go module**: the wallet-SDK-shaped adapter. The root module does not import it, so no wallet SDK is a dependency of soroauth |

## Untrusted input

`Inspect` and the CLI are pointed at entries from elsewhere by design, so the
base64 decoder and every recursive walk over an entry are bounded on purpose.
`DecodeAuthorizationEntry` applies 64 levels of nesting and 1 MiB of decoded
input, and returns `ErrDecodeLimit` when either bites. `Inspect`,
`ValidateDelegateOrder`, the credential-node walk in
`AuthorizeEntry`, and `WithDelegates` refuse a tree nested past 64 levels for
the same reason. The values and their rationale live on the constants in
`decode.go`. This does not change any emitted bytes: the limits only bound what
the library is willing to read.

## The delegate model

Under CAP-71-01 an account may authenticate through delegated signers instead of
signing itself. The tree can nest arbitrarily:

```
account  (top-level, signature may be ScvVoid)
├── delegate A
│   └── delegate A1        ← nested, same payload
└── delegate B
```

**Every node signs the same payload**, bound to the *top-level* address. Three
consequences the code enforces:

- One address appearing at two depths is filled by a **single** `AuthorizeEntry`
  call, and both nodes receive byte-identical signatures.
- Once any node is signed the expiration is fixed; signing another node at a
  different `validUntilLedger` is refused.
- Each delegates array is sorted by the **XDR encoding** of the address and
  checked for duplicates within that level. Across levels, repeats are legal.

An unsigned node only fails if the account's `__check_auth` calls
`delegate_account_auth` for it — the host then passes that node's signature to
the delegate (CAP-71-01, *Semantics → `delegate_account_auth`*). The recommended
contract pattern delegates to every listed signer, so treat unsigned nodes as
failing unless you know the account's policy.

## Correctness model

soroauth is evidence-driven. Two independent gates:

**Golden vectors** — `testdata/vectors/*.json`, generated by
`testdata/gen/gen.mjs` against a pinned `@stellar/stellar-sdk@17.1.0`. For each
case `golden_test.go` asserts the preimage bytes, the payload hash, and the
final signed entry are byte-identical to the reference. Delegate vectors also
reproduce `WithDelegates` from the recorded *unsorted* input, so ordering is
proven rather than re-read. CI regenerates and fails on drift.

**Live testnet** — `e2e/` (build tag `e2e`) submits real transactions covering
all three arms, classic multisig, three contract fixtures (`modular-account`,
`session-keys`, `threshold-account`), and deliberate rejections that assert the
*specific* error: the host's for a refused signature, and the contract's own
code for an expired session key or an M-1 threshold. Results in
[e2e/RESULTS.md](e2e/RESULTS.md).

The rejection scenarios matter as much as the acceptances: they are what stop
the accepting scenarios from passing by accident. Two of them originally passed
while proving nothing, which is why every new failure test must assert *which*
failure.

The passkey path — browser ceremony, assertion verification, the challenge-binding
check, and which wallet contract a signature ScVal targets — has its own guide:
[docs/passkeys.md](docs/passkeys.md). Teams replacing hand-rolled signing code
have [docs/migrating.md](docs/migrating.md): pattern mappings, the four JS-SDK
differences, and the byte-identical verification step.

## Non-goals

soroauth is not a transaction builder, an RPC client, a key manager, or a
human-readable "what am I signing" explainer. It consumes go-stellar-sdk's
`txnbuild` and `clients/rpcclient` rather than wrapping them, and `Inspect`
reports structure only. `adapters/walletsdk` is the one place a wallet SDK is
named, and it is a module of its own so that importing soroauth never drags
one along.

## Extending it

- **New signer**: implement `Signer`. The `ScVal` you return is written verbatim.
- **Anything touching the wire format**: cite the CAP and ship a golden vector.
- **New rejection test**: assert the specific host error, not just failure.
