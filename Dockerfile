# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Builds the soroauth CLI only. This image never bakes in a key: soroauth
# sign reads a secret seed from a named environment variable at run time
# (--secret-env), the same as running the binary directly, and the seed
# should be injected by whatever starts the container (e.g. `docker run -e`,
# a CI secret, or an orchestrator's secret store) rather than baked into the
# image or this Dockerfile.
